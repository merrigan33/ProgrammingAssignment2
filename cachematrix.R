# The first function, makeVector creates a special "vector", which is really a list containing a function to

# 1 set the value of the vector
# 2 get the value of the vector
# 3 set the value of the mean
# 4 get the value of the mean

makeVector <- function(x = numeric()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setmean <- function(mean) m <<- mean
  getmean <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setmean = setmean,
       getmean = getmean)
}

# The following function calculates the mean of the special "vector" created with the above function. 
# However, it first checks to see if the mean has already been calculated. If so, it gets the mean 
# from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the mean of the data and sets 
# the value of the mean in the cache via the setmean function.

cachemean <- function(x, ...) {
  m <- x$getmean()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- mean(data, ...)
  x$setmean(m)
  m
}

##### makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse. #####

# These functions are to cache the inverse of a matrix 

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y){
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setInverse <- function(solveMatrix) inv <<- solveMatrix
  getInverse <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get, setInverse = setInverse, getInverse = getInverse)
}

# cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
# If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve 
# should retrieve the inverse from the cache. Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with 
# the solve function in R. For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse.
# This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  inv <- x$getInverse()
  if(!is.null(inv)){
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(data)
  x$setInverse(inv)
  inv      
}
